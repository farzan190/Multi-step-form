# Multi-Step Form

This is a **Multi-Step Form** project built with **ReactJS** and **Context API**. The app allows users to select a plan, choose features, and enter personal details in a multi-step process, making the form filling experience more intuitive. The form includes a pricing page, plan selection, and a dynamic progress tracker.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Navigation**: The form collects user data step-by-step, guiding the user through a series of decisions such as selecting a plan and adding extra features.
- **Plan Selection**: Users can choose from multiple plans with different pricing, and select additional features based on the plan they choose. 
- **Dynamic Pricing**: The pricing dynamically updates based on the chosen plan and additional features.
- **Validation**: Ensures that all fields are correctly filled out before moving to the next step.
- **Context API**: Uses Context API to manage form state globally, allowing easy data flow between different steps.
- **Progress Indicator**: A visual indicator shows users how far they are in the process.


## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface and managing the app's state and for handling logic such as form validation, plan selection, and pricing updates.
- **Context API**: For managing global state and handling data across different steps of the form.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
